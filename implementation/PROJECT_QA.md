# PulseVision - rPPG Heart Rate Detection Project Q&A

## **Project Overview**

### Q: What is PulseVision?
**A:** PulseVision is a real-time heart rate monitoring system that uses remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) to detect heart rate from video of a person's face, without any physical contact or sensors.

### Q: What is rPPG?
**A:** Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method that uses video cameras to detect subtle color changes in the skin caused by blood volume changes during the cardiac cycle. When the heart pumps blood, it causes slight color variations in the face that can be captured and analyzed.

### Q: What are the advantages of rPPG over traditional methods?
**A:** 
- **Non-contact**: No need for physical sensors or electrodes
- **Convenient**: Works with standard webcams
- **Continuous monitoring**: Real-time heart rate detection
- **Cost-effective**: Uses existing camera hardware
- **Comfortable**: No skin irritation or discomfort

## **Technical Pipeline Questions**

### Q: How does the system work step by step?
**A:** The pipeline follows these 11 steps:
1. **Input Video** - Capture video from webcam or file
2. **Face Detection** - Use MediaPipe to detect facial landmarks
3. **ROI Tracking** - Track forehead and cheek regions
4. **Green Channel Extraction** - Extract green color intensity
5. **Multi-ROI Signal Combination** - Combine signals from multiple regions
6. **Signal Preprocessing** - Filter and clean the signal
7. **Heart Rate Estimation** - Use FFT to find heart rate frequency
8. **Signal Quality Assessment** - Evaluate signal reliability
9. **Heart Rate Filtering** - Smooth and validate results
10. **FFT Visualization** - Display frequency spectrum
11. **GUI Display** - Show real-time results

### Q: Why do you use the green channel specifically?
**A:** The green channel is most sensitive to blood volume changes because:
- Hemoglobin absorbs green light more effectively than red or blue
- Green light penetrates skin to the depth where blood vessels are located
- It provides the best signal-to-noise ratio for heart rate detection
- It's less affected by ambient lighting variations

### Q: Why use multiple ROIs (forehead and cheeks)?
**A:** Multiple ROIs provide several benefits:
- **Redundancy**: If one region fails, others can compensate
- **Better signal quality**: Different regions may have varying signal quality
- **Motion robustness**: If the person moves, different regions may remain stable
- **Dynamic weighting**: System automatically adjusts weights based on ROI quality

### Q: How does the face detection work?
**A:** We use MediaPipe Face Mesh which:
- Detects 468 facial landmarks in real-time
- Provides robust tracking even with head movement
- Works with various lighting conditions
- Has built-in confidence scoring for reliability

### Q: What is the FFT method and why use it?
**A:** FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) converts the time-domain signal to frequency domain:
- **Purpose**: Find the dominant frequency corresponding to heart rate
- **Range**: Analyzes 0.5-3.0 Hz (30-180 BPM)
- **Advantage**: Robust to noise and artifacts
- **Accuracy**: Provides reliable heart rate estimation

## **Signal Processing Questions**

### Q: How do you handle noise and artifacts?
**A:** Multiple noise reduction techniques:

- **Motion artifact removal**: Statistical outlier detection
- **Smoothing**: Savitzky-Golay filter for temporal smoothing
- **Multi-ROI combination**: Reduces impact of local artifacts

### Q: How do you ensure signal quality?
**A:** Quality assessment includes:
- **SNR**: Signal-to-noise ratio in heart rate band
- **Peak clarity**: How distinct the main frequency peak is
- **Temporal consistency**: Stability of recent measurements
- **ROI health**: Track stability of each region over time
- **Confidence scoring**: Overall reliability assessment

### Q: What happens if the signal quality is poor?
**A:** The system has several fallback mechanisms:
- **Dynamic ROI weighting**: Reduce weight of poor-quality regions
- **Confidence thresholds**: Only accept high-confidence measurements
- **Temporal smoothing**: Use recent good measurements
- **Baseline system**: Maintain stable baseline for 20 seconds
- **Outlier rejection**: Filter out physiologically impossible values
